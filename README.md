ifconfig.php
============

**Simple PHP script to show IP-address, UserAgent and other info**


Added all basic features, such as output in HTML, plain text, XML and JSON.
By default it will be in HTML. Also it is possible to request single value.

Visit some of the links below to view it in action:
* [all in plain text](http://briskin.org/ifconfig.php?q=text)
* [all in xml](http://briskin.org/ifconfig.php?q=xml)
* [useragent only](http://briskin.org/ifconfig.php?q=ua)

P.s.
I've made this script only as an illustration for my article about privacy problems.
For now I have no plans to make it more powerfull, so I would like to recommend
you another good project [ifconfig.co](http://ifconfig.co).
