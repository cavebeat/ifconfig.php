ifconfig.php
============

**Simple PHP script to show IP, UserAgent and other info**


Added all basic features, such as output in HTML, plain text, XML and JSON.
By default it will be in HTML. Use 'f=' arg to select another output format.
Also it is possible to request single value by defining 'q=' arg.

Visit some of the links below to view it in action:
* [all in plain text](http://briskin.org/ifconfig.php?f=text)
* [all in xml](http://briskin.org/ifconfig.php?f=xml)
* [useragent only](http://briskin.org/ifconfig.php?q=ua)

P.s.
I've made this script only as an illustration for my article about privacy problems.
For now I have no plans to make it more powerfull, so I would like to recommend
you another good project [ifconfig.co](http://ifconfig.co).
